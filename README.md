## Documentation

microStudio projects come with a standard document viewing page called Doc.

`doc/doc.md` is the file for that document.

Since there is only one `doc.md` per project, the Japanese translation `doc.ja.md` has been placed in the root of this repository.

This is not included in the library and is for viewing from this repository only.

The reference for each class is described in `reference.md` or `reference.ja.md`.
